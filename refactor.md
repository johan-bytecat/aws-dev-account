# DevCloud Infrastructure Refactor - COMPLETED

The deployment was too fragile with multiple interdependent stacks. Successfully refactored into a clean 2-stack architecture:

## New Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)

### 1. Network Stack (`01-network.yaml`)
**Purpose**: Core networking infrastructure that supports multiple applications
- ✅ VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables
- ✅ Private Hosted Zone (Route53)
- ✅ S3 Scripts Bucket
- ✅ VPN/NAT Gateway Instance with WireGuard
- ✅ Security Groups (VPN/NAT, Private Instance, EFS)
- ✅ IAM Role for NAT instance
- ✅ Complete security group rules (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, WireGuard, NFS)

### 2. Application Stack (`02-application.yaml`)
**Purpose**: Application-specific resources (can deploy multiple independently)
- ✅ Private/Kite Application Server
- ✅ S3 Data Bucket (per application)
- ✅ EFS FileSystem (per application)
- ✅ IAM Role for Application Server
- ✅ Automatic EFS mounting and configuration

## Deployment Scripts (CREATED)

### Primary Scripts:
- ✅ `deploy-network.ps1` - Deploy VPC + NAT infrastructure
- ✅ `deploy-application.ps1` - Deploy application on existing network
- ✅ `upload-scripts.ps1` - Upload initialization scripts to S3
- ✅ `manage-instances-new.ps1` - Start/stop/status instances
- ✅ `destroy-infrastructure.ps1` - Clean teardown

### Benefits Achieved:
1. **Decoupled Architecture**: Network can exist independently of applications
2. **Multiple Applications**: Can deploy different apps on same network
3. **Simplified Dependencies**: Only 2 stacks instead of 6+
4. **Proper Resource Grouping**: EFS+DataBucket with their consuming application
5. **Complete Security Rules**: All ingress/egress rules properly defined
6. **Instance Management**: Unified script to manage all instances

## Key Improvements:

### Security Groups
- Complete ingress/egress rules instead of incomplete configurations
- Proper VPN client access (10.0.0.0/24 range)
- NFS access for EFS from private instances

### IAM Roles
- Consolidated into respective stacks (no separate IAM stack)
- Proper S3 and Route53 permissions
- Stack-specific naming to avoid conflicts

### Dependencies
- Clean import/export pattern between stacks
- Network stack exports all needed values
- Application stack imports from network stack

### EC2 Instance Behavior
**Note**: CloudFormation cannot create EC2 instances in stopped state. They always start as "running" when created. Use `manage-instances-new.ps1 -Action stop` after deployment if needed.

## Usage Examples:

```powershell
# Deploy network infrastructure (simplified - no need for PublicHostedZoneId)
.\deploy-network.ps1 -KeyPairName "bytecatdev1"

# Upload scripts
.\upload-scripts.ps1 -NetworkStackName "devcloud-network"

# Deploy first application
.\deploy-application.ps1 -KeyPairName "bytecatdev1" -ApplicationName "kite-server"

# Deploy second application (different)
.\deploy-application.ps1 -KeyPairName "bytecatdev1" -ApplicationName "web-app" -PrivateInstanceIP "172.16.2.101"

# Manage instances
.\manage-instances-new.ps1 -Action status
.\manage-instances-new.ps1 -Action stop -Instance app -ApplicationStackName "devcloud-app-kite-server"

# Complete cleanup
.\destroy-infrastructure.ps1 -ConfirmDestroy
```

## Migration from Old Architecture:
- `foundation-infrastructure.yaml` → `01-network.yaml` (with NAT instance)
- `iam-roles.yaml`, `iam-roles-new.yaml` → Integrated into respective stacks
- `phase2-vpn-nat.yaml` → Integrated into `01-network.yaml`
- `phase3-private-instance.yaml` → `02-application.yaml`
- `compute-infrastructure.yaml` → **OBSOLETE** (content distributed)

The refactor is complete and production-ready!
